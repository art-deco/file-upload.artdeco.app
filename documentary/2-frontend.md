## Front End

The front-end is implemented as JSX components which are rendered with the _Preact_ library. This allowed the delivered code to be as minimal as possible. The process of building consists of compiling the JSX code into plain JavaScript using the minimal reg-exp based `@a-la/jsx` transpiler. The development version is served using ES modules which are supported by the browser natively, meaning there does not need to be a compilation step involved which is very convenient since the actual compilation by Google Closure takes about a minute. Still, the JSX is not understood by the browser, but the `jsx` middleware installed on the server allows to run the transpilation of JSX source code files when `.jsx` pages are requested. There's no support for JSX source maps, however the code formatting is kept intact so that each line is where the its source is.
